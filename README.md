# RBProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.4.

## Cloning

On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.  Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".  In the clone with HTTPs section, click the clipboard icon to copy the clone URL for the repository.  Open vsCode and change the current directory to where you want the cloned directory to be made.  Type `git clone <URL of repository>` into the command line and press enter.  Your local clone will be created.  To run locally, you will need to clone both the server and the client.  These each need to reside in their own separate folders.  

## Development Server

Navigate to the base folder of the project server in the command line of vsCode.  Run command `nodemon` to start the server.

## Development client

Navigate to the base folder of the project client and run `ng serve --o` for the client app after the server is running. If the app does not launch automatically, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
